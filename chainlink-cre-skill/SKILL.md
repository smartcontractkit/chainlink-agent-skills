# Chainlink CRE Skill

Assist developers working with the Chainlink Runtime Environment (CRE) by looking up the latest documentation at runtime.

## Runtime Pattern

> **⚠️ IMPORTANT — AGENTS MUST READ BEFORE FETCHING ANYTHING:**
> WebFetch may return an empty shell (nav/metadata only, no prose or code) for some URLs. After every WebFetch call, assess quality before using the content.
>
> **After every WebFetch, ask:** Does the response contain actual prose and/or code blocks with more than ~1000 chars of useful content?
>
> **Full fetch cascade — follow in order:**
> 1. **WebFetch** → assess content quality → proceed if substantial
> 2. **Bash curl** (if WebFetch returned a shell) — works on Windows 10+, Linux, and Mac →
>    ```bash
>    curl -s -L -A "Mozilla/5.0 AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/120.0.0.0 Safari/537.36" "<url>"
>    ```
> 3. **Tell the user** → if both fail, report the URL and suggest they open it directly
>
> Apply this cascade to ALL fetches — doc pages, GitHub URLs, and text dumps.

When a user asks a CRE-related question:

1. **Match user intent to a reference file** — Identify which topic best fits the query from the reference files listed below.
2. **Read the matching reference file** — Each entry includes a summary and key technical details. Use these to orient yourself. Do not fetch yet.
3. **Act immediately** — Write the answer or scaffold from your knowledge and the reference file descriptions. Do not fetch as preparation.
4. **Iterate** — Present your response. Ask the user to test or run it. Then loop:
   - Error or gap blocks progress → fetch exactly what the error names → fix → repeat
   - Cannot write a specific part → mark it inline (e.g. `// NEED: exact consensus tag for uint256`) → fetch that one thing → fill it in → continue
   - No error → done

> **⚠️ Do not fetch as preparation. Fetch as resolution.** Only fetch when you can state the exact piece of information you need. If you can't name it precisely, don't fetch.

CRE has runtime-specific constraints (e.g. WASM environment, encoding requirements) that differ from standard assumptions. When a specific gap involves CRE behaviour you are uncertain about, fetch to resolve it — do not guess.

### Code Example Priority

When looking for code examples or implementation details, use the most targeted source first. Apply the fetch cascade above to any URL you fetch:

1. **Individual doc pages first** — Most targeted. Fetch the specific page for the topic using the fetch cascade. Full content is accessible via curl if WebFetch returns a shell.
2. **Repo references second** (`repo-*.md`) — Use when the doc page lacks sufficient code, or the user explicitly wants a working implementation (templates, SDK examples, demo apps).
3. **Full-text doc dumps last** (`llms-full-ts.txt` / `llms-full-go.txt`) — 35,000-word plain-text dumps linked from `general.md`. Use only when you can't identify a specific doc page or need broad coverage.

**How to work through this list:**
- Fetch the single most relevant URL from the highest-priority source first. Read it fully.
- Stop as soon as you have enough to answer the question. Do not fetch more to verify or feel confident.
- Only move to the next priority source if the current one was genuinely insufficient.
- Never follow links found in fetched content — only fetch URLs explicitly listed in reference files.
- When fetching from repo reference files, fetch only the specific file you need. Do not browse directories or read adjacent files.
- 3-5 URLs is a ceiling, not a target. Most questions need 1-2 fetches.

### CLI Command Priority

When looking up CRE CLI commands, flags, or usage:

1. **Run `cre <command> --help` locally** — Most authoritative and version-accurate. Use this first if the CLI is installed.
2. **Individual CLI doc pages** — Fetch the specific command page via the fetch cascade. Targeted and accessible.
3. **`repo-cre-cli.md`** — Auto-generated markdown for every command. Use if the above don't cover the query.
4. **Full-text doc dumps / other** — Last resort.

**How to work through this list:**
- Fetch the single most relevant URL from the highest-priority source first. Read it fully.
- Stop as soon as you have enough to answer the question. Do not fetch more to verify or feel confident.
- Only move to the next priority source if the current one was genuinely insufficient.
- Never follow links found in fetched content — only fetch URLs explicitly listed in reference files.
- When fetching from repo reference files, fetch only the specific file you need. Do not browse directories or read adjacent files.
- 3-5 URLs is a ceiling, not a target. Most questions need 1-2 fetches.

## Workflow Generation Checklist

Follow these additional steps when **generating or scaffolding a new workflow** (not just answering questions):

1. **Determine language** — Before generating any code, confirm whether the user wants Go or TypeScript. Ask directly if not already clear from context.
2. **Choose HTTP capability** — If the workflow involves HTTP requests, ask the user whether they want **regular HTTP** or **Confidential HTTP**. Explain the difference: regular HTTP is the default for standard API calls; Confidential HTTP is an optional capability that provides privacy-preserving requests via enclave execution, secret injection, and optional response encryption. Do not assume one or the other — let the user decide.
3. **Write the scaffold immediately** — Generate the complete workflow structure from your knowledge. Do not fetch first. Mark specific uncertainties inline (e.g. `// NEED: exact consensus tag for uint256`, `// NEED: verify project.yaml structure`).
4. **Present and iterate** — Give the user the scaffold with simulation commands. Ask them to run `cre workflow simulate`. Then loop:
   - Simulation error → fetch exactly what the error names → fix → ask user to re-run
   - Inline gap → fetch that one specific thing → fill it in → continue
   - No error → done
   - One fetch per gap. Never fetch speculatively to prevent hypothetical errors.
5. **Default to simulation** — Always include simulation commands. Only provide deployment steps if the user explicitly requests it. Remind them deployment requires Early Access approval, a funded wallet, and a linked key.

## Repo Reference Files

Repo reference files are a **reliable source** for working code implementations. Use them when individual doc pages lack sufficient code examples, or when the user explicitly wants a template or runnable implementation.

| File | Repo | When to use |
|------|------|-------------|
| [repo-cre-templates.md](references/repo-cre-templates.md) | cre-templates | Starter templates, building blocks, example workflow patterns |
| [repo-cre-sdk-typescript.md](references/repo-cre-sdk-typescript.md) | cre-sdk-typescript | TypeScript SDK source, HTTP trigger package, SDK examples |
| [repo-cre-sdk-go.md](references/repo-cre-sdk-go.md) | cre-sdk-go | Go SDK source, capability implementations, consensus code |
| [repo-cre-prediction-market-demo.md](references/repo-cre-prediction-market-demo.md) | cre-gcp-prediction-market-demo | Prediction market demo app, end-to-end workflow example |
| [repo-cre-cli.md](references/repo-cre-cli.md) | cre-cli | CRE CLI source code and auto-generated command reference docs |

## Debugging Checklist

Follow these steps when **diagnosing errors or fixing broken CRE code**:

1. **Identify the capability involved** — Determine which CRE capability (HTTP client, EVM client, triggers, secrets, consensus, etc.) is related to the error.
2. **Fetch the relevant doc page** — Find the specific doc page for the capability via the matching reference file. Use the fetch cascade to retrieve it.
3. **Check repo examples** — If the doc page lacks a working implementation, consult the matching `repo-*.md` reference file. If still insufficient, fetch the llms-full text dump from `general.md`.
4. **Check known issues** — Review the Known Issues section below for any matching bug or workaround.
5. **Only then propose a fix** — Do not guess from type signatures, general programming knowledge, or first principles. CRE's WASM runtime and capability interfaces have specific requirements that may differ from standard assumptions.
6. **If a fix fails, re-consult docs** — Do not iterate by guessing alternatives. Go back to step 2 and re-read the docs more carefully, or fetch additional related pages.

## Known Issues

### Secret name/env var substring conflict (CRE CLI v1.1.0)

**Problem:** Secret resolution fails with "secret not found" if the env var name in `secrets.yaml` is a substring or prefix of the secret name (the YAML key). For example, secret name `GEMINI_API_KEY_SECRET` with env var `GEMINI_API_KEY` fails because `GEMINI_API_KEY` is a prefix of `GEMINI_API_KEY_SECRET`.

**Workaround:** Ensure the env var name is never a substring/prefix of the secret name. Use a suffix like `_VAR` on the env var (e.g., `GEMINI_API_KEY_VAR`).

**Observed in:** CRE CLI v1.1.0

**Verification test:** Create a `secrets.yaml` with a secret name that contains the env var as a prefix (e.g., key `MY_SECRET_NAME`, env var `MY_SECRET`). Run simulation. If it fails with "secret not found", the bug still exists. If it succeeds, the bug is fixed and this issue can be removed.

## Tips

- Many topics have separate Go and TypeScript pages. Ask the user which language they're using if unclear, or fetch both.
- For workflow generation tasks, follow the Workflow Generation Checklist above, start with `workflow-building.md`, and supplement with `sdk-reference.md` for API details.
- For onboarding, start with `getting-started.md` then `account-setup.md`.
- For code examples, fetch the specific doc page first (via fetch cascade), then repo reference files if more implementation detail is needed.
- Reference file entries contain enriched descriptions from the docs index. Read them carefully to narrow down which URLs to fetch — don't fetch blindly.
- The full docs index with structured JSON metadata is available at `assets/cre-docs-index.md` for deeper search if reference file descriptions aren't sufficient.
